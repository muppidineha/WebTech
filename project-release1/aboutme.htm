          <td class="words">Hi! My name is Neha, and I am what you may call a connoiusser of all
            things food. I have always had a huge sweet tooth since childhood and have
            been obsessed with anything chocolate. Being from a culturally diverse
            hub, however, I quickly found that chocolate was just the tip of the
            iceberg. With various Indian sweet shops and Asian bakeries to my left and
            restaurants galore to my right, I slowly but surely explored quite
            possibly every type of cuisine I could get my hands on. And after years of
            exploring every nook and cranny of the Bay to explore all that the Bay has
            to offer, I think it's safe to say that I may know a thing or two about
            some of the best places to check out when here. <br />
            Having grown up in the Bay, I've always had a special place in my heart
            for all of the unique delicacies that have found a home here. Whether you
            are seeking savory Asian food or trendy desserts, a large chain restaurant
            or a quaint hole-in-the-wall place, I've got you covered!</td>
